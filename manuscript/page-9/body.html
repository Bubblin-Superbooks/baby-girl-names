        The challenge was always finding the right <em>keyword</em>. And its meaning or usage all around the world.

			Sonica and I love both Caucasian and Asian names but we did not want our daughter's name
			to be influenced by race, religion or what's popular in the US today.
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing that I noted about our searches is that we would often repeat keywords. Take a suggestion from a friend, and run it around in the family, many times a week, in a hope to incorporate a special meaning, or an honor or social thought.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or we would go in the direction of baking the family tree or cultural tradition into the name. It was tiring.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Her name had to be simple, but also reflect multi-culturalism. It had to be
			short and easy to spell. And with so many flexible constraints, it was imperative
			that we scanned through as many names as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			And so was born this book.
    </p>
		<p>
			Finding a great name for your daughter is a <strong>big responsibility</strong> after all.
			We landed on Zuvy for our child and I hope you will find a name for your baby too.
		</p>
		<p> Stay blessed and healthy. </p>
