			Sonica and I love caucasian names but we also did not want our daughter's name to
			go by what those cheeky most popular suggestions on the Internet say.
		</p>
		<p>
			We wanted to avoid as many confirmation biases as possible.
			Another aspect we noted about our searches was that we would often repeat a result from the shortlisted names. Take a suggestion from a
			friend, and run it through Google. Then go around in the family in a hope to incorporate a consensus.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes we would go in the direction of baking the family name or a cultural cue into the name, but it always turned out to be a little too much for us.
		</p>

		<p>
			We knew our baby's name had to be simple. Short and stylish. It had to reflect the multi-culturalism our family reflects and speak to a secular way of life. 
			Having scanned through as many names as possible, we landed on Zuvy for our baby which I hope our daughter will like when she grows up.
		</p>
		<p>
			And so is born this book as well.
