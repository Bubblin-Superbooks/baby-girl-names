			Hey there!

		<p>Welcome to the universal book of baby girl names.</p>
		<p>
			First off, congratulations on the news of your baby. This must be so exciting!
			I know that feeling because Sonica and I are going through our first pregnancy right now, as we create this
			book.
		</p>
		<p>
			A collection of 70,000 alphabetically sorted girl names sourced from all over the world.
			With this book in your hands, you cannot miss a good name for your daughter. Well, if we have missed one,
			feel free to contribute with <a href="https://github.com/marvindanig/baby-girl-names.git" class="">pull
				requests</a>!

		<p>The book is open source.</p>

			Finding a great name for your daughter can be challenging. And the challenge is always in finding the right
			<em>keywords.</em>
