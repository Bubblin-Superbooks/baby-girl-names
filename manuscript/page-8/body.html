	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p class="no-indent start-chapter">
		Welcome new parents.
		Congratulations for the news of your baby girl. Yay!
		This must be so exciting for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		I know the feeling because Sonica, my wife, and I are going through
		our first pregnancy too. And while we are at it, both of us are always
    looking for a cool and unique name for our daughter.</p>
    <p>
      Do you have a suggestion to make? ðŸ˜‡
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing that I noted about our searches is that we would often repeat keywords. Take a suggestion from a friend, and run it around in the family, many times a week, in a hope to incorporate a special meaning, or an honor or social thought.
    </p>
    <p>
		Or we would go in the direction of baking the family tree or cultural tradition into the name. It was tiring.
