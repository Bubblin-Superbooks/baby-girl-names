	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p class="no-indent start-chapter">
		Welcome new parents.
		Congratulations for the news of your baby girl.
		This must be so <strong>exciting</strong> for you!
	</p>
	<p>
		I know the feeling because Sonica, my wife, and I are going through
		our first pregnancy ourselves. And while we are at it, we are always
		looking for a cool and unique name for our daughter. Have a suggestion to make?
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing that I noted about our search for <em>the</em> name is that we would often repeat our searches with a keyword, a multiple times a day,
		over weeks, in a hope to incorporate a special meaning that we liked, or an honor or a social thought.
		Or we would go in the direction of baking the family tree or a cultural tradition into the name. It was tiring.
	</p>
	<p class="stretch-last-line">
		The challenge was always finding the right <em>keyword</em>.
