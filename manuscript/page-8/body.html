		First off, congratulations on your baby girl.
	</p>
	<p>
		You must be <em>excited!</em> ðŸ˜‡
	</p>
	<p>
		I know that feeling because Sonica, my wife, and I went through
		those beautiful trimesters as well. We had been looking for a smart
		and unique name frantically, and would often repeat our searches
		a multiple times over, in a hope to incorporate a special meaning,
		or honor a family or cultural tradition.
	</p>
	<p>
		We love Caucasian names but also did not want our daughter to be named
		by sorted popularity, to avoid confirmation bias in the US.</p>
	<p>
		Thus was born this book. After all, choosing a great name for your daughter is a big responsibility.
