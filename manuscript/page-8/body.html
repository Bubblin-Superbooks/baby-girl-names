	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p class="no-indent start-chapter">
		First off, congratulations on your baby girl.
	</p>
	<p>
		This must be so <strong>exciting</strong> for you! ðŸ˜‡
	</p>
	<p>
		I know the feeling because Sonica, my wife, and I went through
		those beautiful trimesters ourselves. And while at it, we were frantically
		looking for a smart, cool and unique name for our daughter.
	</p>
	<p>
		We would often repeat our searches, a multiple times a day over weeks, in
		a hope to incorporate a special meaning, or honor or a thought or a family or cultural tradition.
		It was tiring.
	</p>
	<p>
		We both love Caucasian and Asian names but we also did not want our daughter's name
		to be influenced by race, religion or what's popular in the US today.
		The name had to be both simple and reflect multiculturalism.</p>
	<p>
		And thus was born this book.
		A collection of 70,000 sorted names from the last 100 years of women in America.
		With this book in your hands, you cannot miss the name for your daughter!
	</p>
	<p>
		Choosing a great name for your daughter is a <strong>big responsibility</strong> after all.</p>
