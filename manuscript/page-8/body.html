		Hey there! 
	</p>
	<p>Welcome to the universal book of baby girl names.</p>
	<p>
		First off, congratulations on the news of your baby. This must be so exciting!
		I know that feeling because Sonica and I are going through our first pregnancy right now, as we create this book. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A collection of 70,000 alphabetically sorted girl names sourced from all over the world.
		With this book in your hands, you cannot miss a good name for your daughter. Well, if we have missed one, contributions via pull requests are super welcome!
	</p>
	<p>Name your princess with style!</p>
	<p>
		Finding a great name for your daughter is a <strong>big responsibility</strong> after all.
		We landed on Zuvy for our child and I hope you will find a name for your baby too.
